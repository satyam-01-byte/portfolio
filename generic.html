							<h1 class="major">How to Learn Anything Better and Overcome Learning Barriers</h1>
							<p>How often have you started to learn something new, but even after working on it for a lot of days, seem to make no progress at all? The problem is not your mind but how you are using it to learn. There are numerous ways how you can improve your efficiency at learning something new and make immense progress. This blog post will cover the problems that occur while learning, how to avoid them, and how to learn at ease.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/learn.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><b>The heavy pressure before starting something new:</b>
								<br>
								Quite often before we step into learning something completely new: maybe a new language, an instrument, or anything at all,  it can feel very daunting. Looking at the number of things to learn at hand, and looking at people who have already achieved it can make you feel overwhelmed. But, if it is something that you want to do, then you have to get the past that feeling, and that can only happen once you start. As the Law of Serendipity states that once we make up our minds, the Universe bends in our direction by providing us with seemingly accidental and unexpected fortuitous circumstances which we call good luck. Or, in the words of Barbara Oakley - <i>"Lady Luck favors the one who tries."</i>
								<br>
								So, before we start we should be sure of it and then, study from the people who have done it before us for inspiration, tips, and motivation. There's always somebody else there who has done what you want to do before you in any field of work, and the internet is full of these people who have shared their journey and how they did it. They share their resources and also the mistakes to avoid. How great is that? So, just look up on how to get started in whatever you want to learn and jot down the points. Form them into steps, goals, plans, and let's get started.</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/brain.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><b>The two states of our mind:</b>
								<br>
								Our brain works in two ways: the focused state and the diffused state. 
								<br>
								The focused state is a highly attentive state of mind where the brain uses its best concentration abilities in the prefrontal cortex to ignore all extraneous information. In this state, our brain acts as a one-track mind ignoring all distractions. Whether it's a math problem or a sport skill, our brain focuses on the most important things.
								<br>
								The diffused state is a free mind. When we let our minds wander and work on its own. This doesn't seem like a good idea, right? But, it is equally important while learning something because this is when our brain has the opportunity to connect the dots and link neural processes. This is when the information taken in during focused state is made concrete in our memory.
								<br>
								There are a lot of people who have used these two states to their advantage in their works, for example, Salvadore Dali, Thomas Alva Edison, and others. After a period of focused learning, they switched to a relaxed, diffused state and let their thoughts run them, and kept alternating between the two states. That way, they generated new ideas and also learnt better.
								<br>
								<br>
								<em>Working memory and long-term memory:</em>
								<br>
								Our working memory is used to learn something new. The limitation according to brain experts is that we have only four units or slots in our working memory. So, we can't focus on a lot of things at once which proves multitasking is bad.
								<br>
								Our long-term memory can store huge amounts of information and it has a lot of space. It's like a huge storage unit where things from working memory can be placed systematically and in order.
								Hence, to move information from our temporary working memory to permanent long-term memory, we need to keep practicing. 
								<br>
								<br>
								One mistake to avoid here is, to not try to gobble up too much information or do a lot, all at once. If you try to do this, it often leads to early breakdown. After a certain period without relaxation, our brain refuses to use it's energy efficiently and it's mostly a waste of time. So, instead of doing it all at once, space it. This is called the space technique where you distribute your work into different days and at different times, ensuring that you get enough focused and relaxed state. It will help you learn better and in a less stressful way.

								<p><b>The importance of sleep in better learning:</b> 
									<br>
									In our super-competitive world, where the lesser we sleep, the more hard-working we are. In a digital age, where our sleep patterns have been f**ked, sleeping lesser isn't doing much better for us because just like exercise, sleep is very important for our brains to reset, solidify information, and eliminate the unimportant. Here's a list of just a few reasons why sleep is heavily important:
									<br>
									⦁    It gets rid of unwanted toxins making more space
									<br>
									⦁    It erases unimportant information and solidifies, rehearses the important
									<br>
									⦁    Overall health benefits
									<br>
									<br>
									So, the next time you decide to binge-watch that show till 3 am remember, what you are messing up. YOUR OWN LIFE.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Procrastination and how to avoid it:</b>
									<br>
									Oh, how often we procrastinate whenever something seems overwhelming or hard. We don't face it or complete it but, choose to avoid it. How do we do it? Very easy. We look for distractions, and that's not very hard to find, is it? The internet is at our service to help us procrastinate(owing to our low attention span), and help us avoid doing the dreadful stuff. Once we find some other interesting stuff, we completely forget the task in hand until the deadline calls or regret knocks on our doors.  But, remember it isn't going to go away if we choose not to do it. 
									<br>
									<br>
									Procrastination can be broken down and gotten rid of with 4 steps:
									<br>
									1. The Cue: Find what triggers you, what you dislike doing but is important, and change how you react to it. How? See the next step.
									<br>
									2. The routine: What do you do to avoid the important stuff? For some, it may be Youtube-binge watch, or infinite Instagram feed scrolling or watching a new show. You need to eliminate this routine. You need to make up your mind and stop this reaction to your cue. But, it won't be easy. Hence, you need to change the way you react. Fill your routine with something less important.
									<br>
									3. The reward: Just like the internet, rewards us with dopamine. We need to reward ourselves when we do something hard but important. No matter how small that maybe, we should learn to reward ourselves and romanticize our lives.
									<br>
									4. The belief: You need to remember why you've chosen not to procrastinate. You need to have a greater vision, a greater goal. Believe in something to help you make your decisions.
									<br>
									<br>
									<i>Pomodoro technique: </i>If it is something really tough, use the Pomodoro timer. Do it just for 25 mins with no interruptions and complete focus. Take 5 mins break, reward yourself and repeat.</p>

									<p><b>Some common mistakes to avoid while learning:</b> 
										<br>
										a.    Don't get hung up on something that you don't understand, instead move on, and come back to it later. There are higher chances that you will understand it later after forgetting about it and feeling relaxed.
										<br>
										b.    Avoid the illusion of competence: Don't just look at a solution and think you understand it. Do it yourself and until you can teach it to somebody else, you haven't learned it well enough.
										<br>
										c.    Do not overlearn: Overlearning in a single session is useless. Split it into different sessions.
										<br>
										d.    Avoid the Einstellung: This is when you become rigid with how and what you have learned and avoid learning new thoughts or ways. There is always something better, so be open to new ideas, always.
										<br>
										<br>
										<em>I hope this helps you to learn anything new better and that you keep learning, always.
											<b>Happy learning to you.</b></em></p>
